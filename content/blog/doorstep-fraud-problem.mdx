Margaret, 82, lives alone in a semi-detached house in Leeds. Last November, a man knocked on her door wearing a high-vis jacket and carrying a clipboard. He said there was a gas leak on her street and he needed to check her boiler. Margaret let him in. While he "inspected" the kitchen, his colleague — who had slipped in through the back door — took £400 in cash from her bedroom dresser and a gold watch that belonged to her late husband.

Margaret didn't realise what had happened until the next morning. The police took a report. Nothing came of it.

She is one of thousands. And the scam that caught her has been working, almost unchanged, for over fifty years.

## £57 Million a Year, and Nobody's Counting Properly

Doorstep crime costs UK victims an estimated **£57 million annually**. The average victim is over 75. The conviction rate is below 5%.

Those figures almost certainly understate the problem. Age UK estimates that only a fraction of doorstep crime is reported. Victims are often embarrassed, confused about what happened, or convinced that nothing will be done. Many don't realise they've been targeted until days or weeks later — if they realise at all.

This isn't petty crime. It is a systematic, organised form of fraud that targets the most vulnerable people in our communities, and it operates with near-total impunity.

## The Playbook That Never Changes

The mechanics of doorstep fraud have barely evolved because they don't need to. The formula is simple and devastatingly effective:

**Uniform + clipboard + confidence = access.**

The criminal arrives looking the part. A high-vis jacket. An ID badge on a lanyard. A clipboard with official-looking paperwork. They claim to be from the council, the water board, the gas company, or a charity. They use language designed to create urgency: "We've detected a problem." "This is a routine safety check." "Your neighbours have already let us in."

Then comes the distraction burglary. One "inspector" engages the homeowner in conversation — often in the kitchen or living room — while another moves through the property. They're looking for cash, jewellery, bank cards, and personal documents. The entire operation takes less than ten minutes.

The gas board scam has been documented since the 1970s. It still works because the fundamental vulnerability hasn't changed: **there is no simple, reliable way to verify who is standing at your door**.

## Why the Elderly Are Targeted

Doorstep criminals target older people deliberately. Not because they're easy marks, but because the conditions are right:

- **Trust.** People over 75 grew up in an era when authority figures were trusted and unexpected visitors were normal. The meter reader, the rent collector, the parish visitor — these were part of daily life.
- **Isolation.** Many elderly people live alone. There's no one else in the house to question the visitor, challenge the story, or notice someone moving through the hallway.
- **Lower digital awareness.** Online fraud gets the headlines, but doorstep crime persists precisely because it's analogue. It doesn't require the victim to click a link or download an app. It just requires them to open the door.
- **Reluctance to report.** Victims often feel ashamed. They worry their family will think they can't cope. They don't want to be seen as a burden. So the crime goes unreported, the criminal goes uncaught, and the cycle continues.

## What Would Actually Help

The standard advice — "don't open the door to strangers," "always check ID," "call the company to verify" — puts the entire burden on the victim. It asks an 82-year-old living alone to become their own security service.

That's not a solution. It's an abdication of responsibility.

What would actually help is a system that makes verification simple enough to happen before the door opens. Not complicated technology. Not a smartphone app that requires a tutorial. A straightforward process:

- The person at the door has a **verified digital identity** linked to their employer or organisation
- The homeowner — or their family member, carer, or neighbour — can **confirm that identity in 30 seconds** with a quick scan
- That scan creates a **timestamped, tamper-proof record** of who was at the door, when, and on whose behalf

If the person is legitimate, they're verified instantly. If they're not, the absence of verification is the warning sign. No verification, no entry. Simple as that.

## Who Benefits

This isn't just about protecting the elderly — though that alone would be reason enough.

**Families** gain peace of mind. When your mum says someone came to check the boiler, you can see exactly who it was, when they arrived, and that they were verified. No more anxious phone calls. No more hoping for the best.

**Legitimate utility workers and tradespeople** benefit enormously. They face hostility and suspicion at the door every day because of criminals who impersonate them. A verified identity that proves they are who they claim to be makes their job easier and safer.

**Police and enforcement agencies** gain something they currently lack: an evidence trail. When every legitimate visit is recorded, the illegitimate ones stand out. A timestamped, geolocated verification record is the kind of evidence that turns a report into a prosecution.

**Care workers and community visitors** — district nurses, social workers, charity volunteers — can prove their identity instantly, building trust with the people they're there to help.

## The Door Should Be a Checkpoint, Not a Vulnerability

We verify identity at airports, banks, and office buildings. We accept it as normal. But the front door of an elderly person's home — one of the highest-risk access points in daily life — has no verification at all.

The technology to fix this exists today. [Two-way identity verification](/solutions/person/) that works in 30 seconds, creates accountability, and doesn't require the victim to be their own security team.

The question is whether we'll implement it before the next Margaret opens her door to the wrong person.
